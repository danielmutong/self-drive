A car detection alogrithm using Tensorflow with the Yolov3 model has been implemented after referencing this site: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-perform-object-detection-with-yolov3-in-keras/
However, the final product runs too slowly (less than 1 fps) to be integrated with the rest of the project at this time.
